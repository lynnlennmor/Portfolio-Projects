# Data Projects

Hello! This repository contains my catalog of projects completed in various data analytics/engineering self development exercises/projects, each of which covers essential skills and techniques.

Fun personal passion project where I crated a simple Data Pipeline for NFL data showcasing a full analytics workflow from Python data extraction to SQL transformation and Tableau visualization using real NFL data.

## [Data Cleaning in SQL](https://github.com/lynnlennmor/Data-Cleaning-SQL/blob/main/README.md)
Project where I clean & transform raw housing data in SQL server.

## [Data Cleaning in Pandas](https://github.com/lynnlennmor/Data-Cleaning-Pandas/blob/main/README.md)
Same as the "Data Cleaning in SQL" but done in Pandas. The goal with this project was to try and translate the same data cleaning I did in SQL to Pandas.
