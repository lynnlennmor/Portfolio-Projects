# Data Projects

Hello! This repository contains my catalog of projects completed in various data analytics/engineering self development exercises/projects, each of which covers essential skills and techniques.

## [My Unemployed Warlock: A WoW Data Engineering Pipeline](https://github.com/lynnlennmor/WoW-Data-Engineering-Pipeline/blob/main/README.md)
A super fun end-to-end data project, working on my favorite game where I tried to create a full engineering/analytics workflow - from creating an Addon/Mod to track data, to processing,cleaning and transforming the data and finally, a Tableau visualization to display it. Using real data from my very own WoW Character Dagwood.

## [Data Cleaning in SQL](https://github.com/lynnlennmor/Data-Cleaning-SQL/blob/main/README.md)
Project where I clean & transform raw housing data in SQL server.

## [Data Cleaning in Pandas](https://github.com/lynnlennmor/Data-Cleaning-Pandas/blob/main/README.md)
Same as the "Data Cleaning in SQL" but done in Pandas. The goal with this project was to try and translate the same data cleaning I did in SQL to Pandas.
